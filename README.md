# 💳 Credit Score Classification - Mini Project
👋 Hello folks! Welcome to this exciting mini-project on Credit Score Classification!

## 📝 Project Overview
In this project, we work with a real-world dataset related to credit score evaluation. The dataset includes comprehensive financial and behavioral attributes of individuals such as:

Annual Income

Monthly In-hand Salary

Number of Bank Accounts

Credit Mix

Outstanding Debt

Credit Utilization Ratio

Credit History Age

Payment Behavior

The target variable is the Credit Score, which is categorized into Good, Standard, or Poor.

Our objective is to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline—from data exploration and preprocessing to model training and evaluation—to predict an individual’s credit score category accurately.

## 🎯 Objective
The main goal is to build and compare the performance of multiple classification models to accurately predict an individual’s creditworthiness based on their financial profile.

This classification is essential for financial institutions to:

Perform risk profiling

Assess loan eligibility

Deliver personalized credit solutions

Prevent bad debt and improve repayment rates

## Models Evaluated:
Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

Random Forest

AdaBoost

XGBoost

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
To compare the models and ensure performance consistency, we use the following metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of how well each model distinguishes between different credit score categories.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
The project is implemented using Python, with the help of widely-used data science libraries:

pandas – Data manipulation

numpy – Numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – Visualization and correlation analysis

scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation tools

xgboost – Advanced boosting framework

tensorflow / keras – For building the ANN model

## ✅ Outcome
By analyzing and comparing the performance of all models, we aim to identify the best-performing classifier for credit score prediction.

Key outcomes include:

Improved credit scoring accuracy

Smarter loan decisions by financial institutions

Tailored financial product offerings based on credit behavior

Enhanced credit risk management and regulatory compliance

💡 Thanks for exploring this project! We hope it offers valuable insights into the role of machine learning in financial decision-making.
